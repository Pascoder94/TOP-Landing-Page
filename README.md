GOAL: Test my coding knowledge by creating a webpage with as little help as possible.

CONCLUSION: I am pleasantly surpised by how little I had to actually google, I thought I'd be crying when faced with my failures but instead it went all pretty smoothly (apparently traumatizing myself with plenty of practice and repetition was the right choice). Still I don't feel like things come to me naturally and I can't shake the feeling that I have consistently chose the worst possible path to get to my result every single time.
